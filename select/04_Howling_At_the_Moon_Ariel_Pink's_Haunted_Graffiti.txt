You know now,
Lately I've been thinking about
All those days gone by
How I was just a little boy
And I remember being as defensive
As a cripple,
All those other kids pushing me around
I'd say nothing, I'd just stand there
And I'd dream my song
It's a song of pain
It's called "Howling at the Moon"
Wish upon a star that's bright
Count on your dreams filling the night
As comets race across the moon
You see that love is coming soon
Howling at the moon
(Howling at the moon)
Uh, feel the love now
Love is power
And the power's strong, uh
Can you feel it, feel it babe
Love is on the way home (yeah)
On the way
Love is on the way home
Now hit me, darling
Now hold it back, it back
Let's sing it together, babe
Hurry, hurry
Love is on the way home
On the way...
